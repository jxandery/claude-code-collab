# Host Instructions

**For the person creating and starting the Claude Code session**

Use this guide every time you want to start a new collaboration session.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting:

- [ ] Server is set up (see [SERVER-SETUP.md](SERVER-SETUP.md))
- [ ] You have the server IP address (e.g., `68.183.159.246`)
- [ ] You have the server username (e.g., `claudeteam`)
- [ ] Scripts are installed on your local machine (`./install.sh`)
- [ ] You pulled the latest code: `cd ~/claude-code-collab && git pull`

---

## Quick Reference

**Server:** `68.183.159.246` (replace with your server IP)
**Username:** `claudeteam` (replace with your server username)
**Session:** `claude-collab` (or choose your own name)

---

## Step 0: Update Code Everywhere

**IMPORTANT:** Before each session, ensure everyone has the latest code.

### Update code on your local machine

```bash
cd ~/claude-code-collab
git pull
```

If you get merge conflicts, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#problem-git-pull-shows-divergent-branches)

### Update code on the server

```bash
ssh claudeteam@68.183.159.246
cd ~/claude-code-collab
git pull
exit
```

---

## Step 1: Clean Up Old Sessions (Optional)

If you want to start fresh, kill any old session with the same name:

```bash
ssh claudeteam@68.183.159.246
tmux kill-session -t claude-collab
exit
```

**Note:** This only kills the specific session (`claude-collab`), not other sessions you might have running.

**Skip this step** if you want to resume an existing session.

---

## Step 2: Create the Claude Code Session

### A. SSH into the server

```bash
ssh claudeteam@68.183.159.246
```

### B. Navigate to your project directory

```bash
cd ~/claude-code-collab
# Or navigate to wherever you want to work
```

### C. Create a new tmux session

```bash
tmux new-session -s claude-collab
```

**What you'll see:** Your terminal will change - usually a green status bar appears at the bottom.

### D. Start Claude Code

```bash
claude-code
```

**Wait for:** The Claude welcome screen to load (shows "Welcome back [Your Name]!" and recent activity).

This may take 5-10 seconds.

### E. Detach from the session

**This is the important part** - you need to detach so others can connect.

**Method 1: Keyboard shortcut (recommended)**

1. Press and hold `Ctrl` + `B` together
2. Release both keys
3. Press `D` (just D by itself)

**What you should see:** `[detached (from session claude-collab)]`

**Common mistake:** If you see the letter "D" typed in your terminal, you did it wrong. Make sure to press `Ctrl+B` first, release, THEN press D.

**Method 2: Type a command**

If the keyboard shortcut isn't working:
```bash
tmux detach
```

**Troubleshooting:** If you see "no server running", the tmux session isn't active. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#problem-tmux-detach-says-no-server-running)

### F. Verify the session is running

```bash
tmux ls
```

**Expected output:**
```
claude-collab: 1 windows (created Wed Nov 27 12:34:56 2025)
```

### G. Exit SSH

```bash
exit
```

You're now back on your local machine.

---

## Step 3: Connect Your Input Terminal

Now connect from your **local machine** to send commands to Claude.

Choose **ONE** of the two options below:

---

### Option A: Split-Pane Mode (RECOMMENDED)

This gives you Claude output and input in one window.

**From your local machine:**

```bash
./join-claude-session-split.sh host 68.183.159.246 claudeteam claude-collab
```

**Replace these values:**
- `host` - Your name/identifier
- `68.183.159.246` - Your server IP
- `claudeteam` - Your server username
- `claude-collab` - Your session name

**What you'll see:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Top Pane (70%)                          │
│ Claude Code Output                      │
│ [Shows Claude's responses in real-time] │
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Bottom Pane (30%)                       │
│ Your Input Terminal                     │
│ [host]> _                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Usage:**
- Type in the bottom pane
- Watch responses in the top pane
- Both panes are in the same terminal window

**To exit:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the bottom pane, or close the terminal

---

### Option B: Simple Mode

This gives you just an input terminal. You'll need a separate terminal to watch Claude's output.

#### B1. Connect your input terminal

**From your local machine:**

```bash
ssh claudeteam@68.183.159.246
join-claude-session.sh host claude-collab
```

**What you'll see:**

```
=== Your Input Terminal ===
Type your prompts below. They will be prefixed with [host]
Press Ctrl+C to exit

[host]> _
```

#### B2. Open a second terminal to view output (optional)

Open a **new terminal window** and run:

```bash
ssh claudeteam@68.183.159.246
tmux attach-session -t claude-collab
```

This lets you watch Claude's responses.

**To detach from view terminal:** Press `Ctrl+B`, then `D`

---

## Step 4: Test Your Connection

Type a test message:

```
[host]> Hello Claude, can you confirm you see this message?
```

**Expected:** You should see Claude respond to your message.

**If nothing happens:** See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#problem-claude-code-not-responding)

---

## Step 5: Invite Collaborators

Your session is ready! Now collaborators can join.

**Send them:**
1. [COLLABORATOR-INSTRUCTIONS.md](COLLABORATOR-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. Server details:
   - Server IP: `68.183.159.246`
   - Username: `claudeteam`
   - Session name: `claude-collab`

**Tell them which mode you're using:**
- Split-pane mode (recommended)
- Simple mode

Everyone should use the same mode for consistency.

---

## Step 6: Start Collaborating!

### Best practices:

**Use voice chat** (Zoom, Discord, Slack) to coordinate:
```
You: "Let me ask about authentication"
[You type in your terminal]
Collaborator: "That looks good! Can I ask about error handling?"
[Collaborator types in their terminal]
```

**Take turns:**
- One person types at a time
- Wait for Claude to finish responding
- Coordinate who's asking next

**Be clear in your messages:**
```
[host]> Can you implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens?
[collaborator]> What about rate limiting on the auth endpoints?
[host]> Good point! Let's add that too.
```

---

## Managing the Session

### Pause collaboration

Just detach from your terminals:
- **Split-pane mode:** Press `Ctrl+C` or close terminal
- **Simple mode:** Press `Ctrl+C` in input terminal

The session keeps running on the server. You can reconnect anytime.

### Reconnect later

Run the same join command again:
```bash
./join-claude-session-split.sh host 68.183.159.246 claudeteam claude-collab
```

### End the session

When everyone is done:

```bash
ssh claudeteam@68.183.159.246
tmux kill-session -t claude-collab
exit
```

This stops Claude Code and frees up server resources.

---

## Multiple Projects

You can run multiple sessions for different projects:

```bash
# Create project-specific sessions
tmux new-session -s frontend-work
tmux new-session -s backend-api
tmux new-session -s bug-fixes

# Connect to specific session
./join-claude-session-split.sh host 68.183.159.246 claudeteam frontend-work
```

Just make sure everyone connects to the same session name!
