## Method 1: tmate (Instant Sharing)

### What is tmate?

tmate is a fork of tmux that automatically shares your terminal session via public relay servers. No server setup, no port forwarding, no networking knowledge required.

### Architecture

```
┌──────────────┐                                    ┌────────────────┐
│              │                                    │                │
│  Your Mac    │──┐                            ┌───│  Collaborator  │
│  (running    │  │                            │   │  (connects via │

│   Code)      │  │                            │   │                │
└──────────────┘  │    ┌──────────────────┐   │   └────────────────┘
                  └────│  tmate.io relay  │───┘
                       │     servers      │
                       │   (free, public) │
                       └──────────────────┘
```

### Setup Process

**Host (5 minutes):**
1. Install tmate: `brew install tmate`
2. Start tmate: `tmate`
3. Start Claude Code: `claude-code`
4. Get connection string: `tmate show-messages`
5. Share the `ssh XXX@tmate.io` line with collaborator

**Collaborator (1 minute):**
1. Run: `ssh XXX@nyc1.tmate.io`
2. You're in!

### User Attribution

**Manual prefixing required:**
```
[host] Add user authentication
[collaborator] Can we use JWT?
```

Everyone types in the same terminal and must manually add their username prefix.

### Pros

✅ **Instant setup** - works in 5 minutes
✅ **No networking knowledge needed** - zero configuration
✅ **Works from anywhere** - through firewalls, different networks
✅ **Free** - no server costs
✅ **Perfect for demos** - show someone quickly

### Cons

❌ **Manual prefixing** - must type `[username]` yourself
❌ **External dependency** - relies on tmate.io servers
❌ **Less privacy** - traffic routes through tmate.io
❌ **Same terminal** - everyone types in same space
❌ **No input separation** - can't have separate input/output views

### When to Use tmate

- **First time trying collaboration** - test the concept quickly
- **Demos and presentations** - show colleagues how it works
- **Different networks** - when port forwarding isn't possible
- **Quick pairing sessions** - ad-hoc collaboration
- **You're okay with manual prefixes** - typing `[name]` isn't a dealbreaker

## Method 2: SSH+tmux (Professional Setup)

### What is SSH+tmux?

Traditional approach using SSH to connect to a server (your Mac or cloud) that's running a tmux session with Claude Code.

### Architecture

**Option A: Using Your Mac**
```
┌──────────────────┐        SSH         ┌────────────────────┐
│                  │◄───────────────────│                    │

      ▲
      │ Requires port forwarding
      │ on your home router
```

**Option B: Using Cloud Server**
```
┌──────────────┐         SSH         ┌─────────────────┐         SSH         ┌────────────────┐
│              │────────────────────►│                 │◄────────────────────│                │
│  Your Mac    │                     │  Cloud Server   │                     │  Collaborator  │
│              │                     │  ($12/month)    │                     │                │
└──────────────┘                     │  ┌───────────┐  │                     └────────────────┘
                                     │  │   tmux    │  │
                                     │  │ Claude Code│ │
                                     │  └───────────┘  │
                                     └─────────────────┘
```

### Setup Process

**Option A: Your Mac as Server (30-45 min):**
1. Enable Remote Login in System Settings
2. Find your public IP
3. Set up port forwarding on router
4. Install tmux: `brew install tmux`
5. Start shared session: `tmux new-session -s claude-collab`
6. Start Claude Code: `claude-code`
7. Share your IP and username with collaborator

**Option B: Cloud Server (60-90 min):**
1. Create DigitalOcean/AWS server
2. Install tmux and Claude Code
3. Create shared user account
4. Set up SSH keys
5. Start shared session
6. Share server IP with collaborator

**Collaborator:**
1. Install the collaboration script
2. Run: `join-claude-session.sh collaborator`
3. Automatic prefixing works!

### User Attribution

**Automatic prefixing with script:**
- You type: `Add user authentication`
- Script sends: `[host] Add user authentication`
- Claude sees: `[host] Add user authentication`

### Pros

✅ **Automatic user attribution** - script adds `[username]`
✅ **Split-screen interface** - top (view), bottom (input)
✅ **Full control** - you own the infrastructure
✅ **Better privacy** - direct server connection
✅ **Professional setup** - clean UX for regular use
✅ **Input separation** - your own input terminal

### Cons

❌ **More setup time** - 30-90 minutes
❌ **Networking required** - port forwarding or cloud
❌ **Costs money** - $12/month for cloud (or free with your Mac)
❌ **Requires SSH knowledge** - more technical
❌ **Your Mac must stay on** - if using Mac as server

### When to Use SSH+tmux

- **Regular collaboration** - working together frequently
- **Professional projects** - need reliable, clean UX
- **Prefer automatic prefixing** - don't want to type `[name]`
- **Value privacy** - prefer direct connection
- **Have budget** - $12/month is acceptable
- **Technical comfort** - okay with SSH and networking
